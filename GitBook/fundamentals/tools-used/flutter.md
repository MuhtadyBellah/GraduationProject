# Flutter

* **Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit (SDK) created by Google for building cross-platform applications. With Flutter, developers can create visually attractive, natively compiled apps from a single codebase for Android, iOS, Web, Desktop, and even Embedded devices.**
* **Flutter is built on Dart, a programming language created by Google. Dart is optimized for UI development and enables both Ahead-of-Time (AOT) and Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.**
