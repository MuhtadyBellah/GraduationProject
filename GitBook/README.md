## **Overview**

**AR-Commerce** is an innovative e-commerce platform that bridges the gap between online shopping and real-world visualization.

By harnessing the power of Augmented Reality (AR), users can place life-sized 3D models of products directly into their environment—whether it’s a new sofa in their living room or a piece of art on their office wall—before making a purchase.

Built with Flutter on the front end and a microservices-style back end (ASP.NET Core and Laravel), AR-Commerce delivers smooth performance, and a secure checkout powered by Stripe.
